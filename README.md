- Clone the repo and setup the project with `npm install`

- Start the backend server with `npm start`
- Start the frontend app with `npm start` at the frontend repo
- I do make API for updating a Pokémon and API for deleting a Pokémon by Id, but frontend app does not have these functions, so please use these urls to test on your test app
  - Edit Pokemon: 127.0.0.1:5000/api/pokemons/:id
  - Delete Pokemon: 127.0.0.1:5000/api/pokemons/:id
